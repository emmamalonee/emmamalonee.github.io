    "text": "Tampa Bay Lightning had their chance to win three consecutive cups but lost their third year in game six of the 2022 Stanley Cup Finals against the Colorado Avalanche. The last team to win three consecutive cups in a row was the Toronto Maple Leafs in 1962-64 seasons. The Lightning is one of many teams to lose in their third year competing for the Stanley Cup. But what exactly led to Tampa’s loss by game six?\nIn the 2021 season, we saw a massive decrease in goals being scored throughout the season, partly because the regular season games got reduced from 82 to 56 that year and partly because the stadium’s fans significantly decreased, all due to COVID-19. Without fans, players had less of a reward as they scored goals. The Avalanche was the top scorer in the league for the 2021 season but lost in the final four during the playoffs.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\n\nGF20 &lt;- read_csv(\"Project 1 Data/2019-20SeasonStats.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2020)\nGF21 &lt;- read_csv(\"Project 1 Data/2020-21SeasonStats.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2021)\nGF22 &lt;- read_csv(\"Project 1 Data/2021-22SeasonStats.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2022)\n\nNHL &lt;- bind_rows(GF20, GF21, GF22) |&gt; remove_empty(which=\"rows\") |&gt; filter(is.na(Rk) == FALSE)\nNHL2122 &lt;- NHL |&gt; filter(Season != 2020)\n\nTBL &lt;- NHL |&gt; filter(Team == \"Tampa Bay Lightning\") |&gt; filter(Season != 2020)\nCOL &lt;- NHL |&gt; filter(Team == \"Colorado Avalanche\") |&gt; filter(Season != 2020)\nMTL &lt;- NHL |&gt; filter(Team == \"Montreal Canadiens\") |&gt; filter(Season != 2020)\nDAL &lt;- NHL |&gt; filter(Team == \"Dallas Stars\") |&gt; filter(Season != 2020)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=NHL2122, aes(x=Season, y=GF, group=Team), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_point(data=NHL2122, aes(x=Season, y=GF, group=Team), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_line(data=TBL, aes(x=Season, y=GF, group=Team), color=\"#002868\") +\n  geom_point(data=TBL, aes(x=Season, y=GF, group=Team), color=\"#002868\") +\n  geom_line(data=COL, aes(x=Season, y=GF, group=Team), color=\"#6F213B\") +\n  geom_point(data=COL, aes(x=Season, y=GF, group=Team), color=\"#6F213B\") +\n  geom_text(data = TBL |&gt; filter(Season == 2021), aes(x=Season-.25, y=GF, label=Team)) +\n  geom_text(data = TBL |&gt; filter(Season == 2022), aes(x=Season+.25, y=GF, label=Team)) +\n  geom_text(data = COL |&gt; filter(Season == 2021), aes(x=Season-.25, y=GF, label=Team)) +\n  geom_text(data = COL |&gt; filter(Season == 2022), aes(x=Season+.25, y=GF, label=Team)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(2021,2022), limits = c(2020.5, 2022.5)) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Season\", \n    y=\"Goals For\", \n    title=\"The Lightning trail the top 6 teams in goals\", \n    subtitle=\"Colorado led the 2021 season in goals scored, while Florida remained in the top 10.

The NHL added a new team, the Seattle Kraken, who got to choose a player of each desired team aside from the Las Vegas Knights. Kraken chose Yanni Gourde from the Tampa Bay Lightning, a lead scorer of the team. Gourde has yet to break his own personal record of goals scored for a season and playoffs at 64 with the Lightning. Despite the Lightning’s rank being eighth going into the playoffs for the 2022 Stanley Cup Finals, they succeeded in reaching the playoffs without Gourde. However, Tampa Bay scored 109 fewer goals than the leading team in the league that season. But does scoring a considerable amount of goals in hockey automatically make you a desirable Stanley Cup contender?\n\n\nCode\nstats22 &lt;- read_csv(\"Project 1 Data/2021-22SeasonStats.csv\") |&gt; filter(is.na(Team) == FALSE)\nstats21 &lt;- read_csv(\"Project 1 Data/2020-21SeasonStats.csv\") |&gt; filter(is.na(Team) == FALSE)\n\nTBL &lt;- stats22 |&gt; filter(Team == \"Tampa Bay Lightning\")\nCOL &lt;- stats22 |&gt; filter(Team == \"Colorado Avalanche\")\n\nbar1 &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=stats22, aes(x=PTS, y=W), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_smooth(data=stats22, aes(x=PTS, y=W), method=\"lm\", se=FALSE, color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_point(data=TBL, aes(x=PTS, y=W), color=\"#002868\") +\n  geom_point(data=COL, aes(x=PTS, y=W), color=\"#6F213B\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data=TBL, aes(x=PTS, y=W, label=Team)) +\n  geom_text_repel(data=COL, aes(x=PTS, y=W, label=Team)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Points\", \n    y=\"Wins\", \n    ) \n  \nbar2 &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=stats22, aes(x=reorder(Team, PTS),  weight=PTS), fill=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=TBL, aes(x=reorder(Team, PTS),  weight=PTS), fill=\"#002868\") +\n  geom_bar(data=COL, aes(x=reorder(Team, PTS),  weight=PTS), fill=\"#6F213B\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Team\",\n    y=\"Points\"\n  )\n\nbar1 + bar2 +\n  plot_annotation(\n    title=\"The Bolts won the number of games predicted\",\n    subtitle=\"The Lightning falls exactly on the predictor line for wins predicted by goals scored during the season.\",\n    caption=\"\"\n  ) &\n   theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number of goals scored can be a good predictor of how many games a team will win. The Lightning falls precisely on the averaging line, meaning that the number of points they scored throughout the season correctly predicted the number of games they would win. The Avalanche fell short to the left because they scored more points on average during a game but won fewer games than the model predicted.\nIn order to score, the puck must pass behind the goalie successfully. Goalies can face an average of 60 shots per game on goal. Only a handful of shots genuinely make it in each game. So, what if we looked at the goalie’s save percentage?\n\n\nCode\ngoalie20 &lt;- read_csv(\"Project 1 Data/GoalieStats2019-20.csv\")\ngoalie21 &lt;- read_csv(\"Project 1 Data/GoalieStats2020-21.csv\")\ngoalie22 &lt;- read_csv(\"Project 1 Data/GoalieStats2021-22.csv\")\n\nset.seed(1234)\n\ngoalies &lt;- goalie22 |&gt; filter(\n  GP &gt; 47 &\n    SV &gt; 600\n)\n\nTBL &lt;- goalies |&gt; filter(Tm == \"TBL\")\nCOL &lt;- goalies |&gt; filter(Tm == \"COL\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_beeswarm(data=goalies, aes(x=SA, y=`SV%`), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data=TBL, \n    aes(x=SA, y=`SV%`), color=\"#002868\") +\n    geom_beeswarm(\n    data=COL, \n    aes(x=SA, y=`SV%`), color=\"#6F213B\") +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=TBL, \n    aes(x=SA, y=`SV%`, label=Player)) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=COL, \n    aes(x=SA, y=`SV%`, label=Player)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\nlabs(\n    x=\"Shots Against\", \n    y=\"Save Percentage\", \n    title=\"Vasilevskiy saved 114 more in 2022 than Kuemper\", \n    subtitle=\"Kuemper has a higher save percentage against Vaislevskiy but faced devastingly less shots during the 2022 season.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | Emma Malone\"\n    ) +\n   theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen comparing the two goalies, Kuemper has a 92% save percentage for the 2022 season. The top 20 goalies for that season in the NHL all have a 91% or higher save percentage. However, when you compare the number of shots each of the team’s goalies faced, 114 shots is like adding on two extra games Vasilveskiy played if we base it on the average shots a goalie faces per game. If Kuemper and Vasilveskiy faced the same number of shots during a season, one could argue that Vasilveskiy would have the higher save percentage.\nTampa Bay fans were on top of the world for two seasons after winning back-to-back Stanley Cups. They made it to the playoffs after a devasting loss of Gourde to the Krakens and have a solid goalie in the net. By all accounts, they had every chance to win the cup. However, the Avalanche maintained true to their explosive shots, leading to more points during the finals series that won games."
