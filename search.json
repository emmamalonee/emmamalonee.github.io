    "section": "",
    "text": "Tampa Bay Lightning had their chance to win three consecutive cups but lost their third year in game six of the 2022 Stanley Cup Finals against the Colorado Avalanche. The last team to win three consecutive cups in a row was the Toronto Maple Leafs in 1962-64 seasons. The Lightning is one of many teams to lose in their third year competing for the Stanley Cup. But what exactly led to Tampa’s loss by game six?\nIn the 2021 season, we saw a massive decrease in goals being scored throughout the season, partly because the regular season games got reduced from 82 to 56 that year and partly because the stadium’s fans significantly decreased, all due to COVID-19. Without fans, players had less of a reward as they scored goals. The Avalanche was the top scorer in the league for the 2021 season but lost in the final four during the playoffs.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\n\nGF20 &lt;- read_csv(\"Project 1 Data/2019-20SeasonStats.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2020)\nGF21 &lt;- read_csv(\"Project 1 Data/2020-21SeasonStats.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2021)\nGF22 &lt;- read_csv(\"Project 1 Data/2021-22SeasonStats.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2022)\n\nNHL &lt;- bind_rows(GF20, GF21, GF22) |&gt; remove_empty(which=\"rows\") |&gt; filter(is.na(Rk) == FALSE)\nNHL2122 &lt;- NHL |&gt; filter(Season != 2020)\n\nTBL &lt;- NHL |&gt; filter(Team == \"Tampa Bay Lightning\") |&gt; filter(Season != 2020)\nCOL &lt;- NHL |&gt; filter(Team == \"Colorado Avalanche\") |&gt; filter(Season != 2020)\n \nggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=NHL2122, aes(x=Season, y=GF, group=Team), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_point(data=NHL2122, aes(x=Season, y=GF, group=Team), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_line(data=TBL, aes(x=Season, y=GF, group=Team), color=\"#002868\") +\n  geom_point(data=TBL, aes(x=Season, y=GF, group=Team), color=\"#002868\") +\n  geom_line(data=COL, aes(x=Season, y=GF, group=Team), color=\"#6F213B\") +\n  geom_point(data=COL, aes(x=Season, y=GF, group=Team), color=\"#6F213B\") +\n  geom_text(data = TBL |&gt; filter(Season == 2021), aes(x=Season-.25, y=GF, label=Team)) +\n  geom_text(data = TBL |&gt; filter(Season == 2022), aes(x=Season+.25, y=GF, label=Team)) +\n  geom_text(data = COL |&gt; filter(Season == 2021), aes(x=Season-.25, y=GF, label=Team)) +\n  geom_text(data = COL |&gt; filter(Season == 2022), aes(x=Season+.25, y=GF, label=Team)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(2021,2022), limits = c(2020.5, 2022.5)) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Season\", \n    y=\"Goals For\", \n    title=\"The Lightning trail the top 6 teams in goals\", \n    subtitle=\"Colorado led the 2021 season in goals scored, while Florida remained in the top 10.

The NHL added a new team, the Seattle Kraken, who got to choose a player of each desired team aside from the Las Vegas Knights. Kraken chose Yanni Gourde from the Tampa Bay Lightning, a lead scorer of the team. Gourde has yet to break his own personal record of goals scored for a season and playoffs at 64 with the Lightning. Despite the Lightning’s rank being eighth going into the playoffs for the 2022 Stanley Cup Finals, they succeeded in reaching the playoffs without Gourde. However, Tampa Bay scored 109 fewer goals than the leading team in the league that season. But does scoring a considerable amount of goals in hockey automatically make you a desirable Stanley Cup contender?\n\n\nCode\nstats22 &lt;- read_csv(\"Project 1 Data/2021-22SeasonStats.csv\") |&gt; filter(is.na(Team) == FALSE)\nstats21 &lt;- read_csv(\"Project 1 Data/2020-21SeasonStats.csv\") |&gt; filter(is.na(Team) == FALSE)\n\nTBL &lt;- stats22 |&gt; filter(Team == \"Tampa Bay Lightning\")\nCOL &lt;- stats22 |&gt; filter(Team == \"Colorado Avalanche\")\n\nbar1 &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=stats22, aes(x=PTS, y=W), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_smooth(data=stats22, aes(x=PTS, y=W), method=\"lm\", se=FALSE, color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_point(data=TBL, aes(x=PTS, y=W), color=\"#002868\") +\n  geom_point(data=COL, aes(x=PTS, y=W), color=\"#6F213B\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data=TBL, aes(x=PTS, y=W, label=Team)) +\n  geom_text_repel(data=COL, aes(x=PTS, y=W, label=Team)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Points\", \n    y=\"Wins\", \n    ) \n  \nbar2 &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=stats22, aes(x=reorder(Team, PTS),  weight=PTS), fill=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=TBL, aes(x=reorder(Team, PTS),  weight=PTS), fill=\"#002868\") +\n  geom_bar(data=COL, aes(x=reorder(Team, PTS),  weight=PTS), fill=\"#6F213B\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Team\",\n    y=\"Points\"\n  )\n\nbar1 + bar2 +\n  plot_annotation(\n    title=\"The Bolts won the number of games predicted\",\n    subtitle=\"The Lightning fall precisely on the predictor line for wins predicted by goals scored.\",\n    caption=\"\"\n  ) &\n   theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number of goals scored can be a good predictor of how many games a team will win. The Lightning falls precisely on the averaging line, meaning that the number of points they scored throughout the season correctly predicted the number of games they would win. The Avalanche fell short to the left because they scored more points on average during a game but won fewer games than the model predicted.\nIn order to score, the puck must pass behind the goalie successfully. Goalies can face an average of 60 shots per game on goal. Only a handful of shots genuinely make it in each game. So, what if we looked at the goalie’s save percentage?\n\n\nCode\ngoalie20 &lt;- read_csv(\"Project 1 Data/GoalieStats2019-20.csv\")\ngoalie21 &lt;- read_csv(\"Project 1 Data/GoalieStats2020-21.csv\")\ngoalie22 &lt;- read_csv(\"Project 1 Data/GoalieStats2021-22.csv\")\n\nset.seed(1234)\n\ngoalies &lt;- goalie22 |&gt; filter(\n  GP &gt; 47 &\n    SV &gt; 600\n)\n\nTBL &lt;- goalies |&gt; filter(Tm == \"TBL\")\nCOL &lt;- goalies |&gt; filter(Tm == \"COL\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_beeswarm(data=goalies, aes(x=SA, y=`SV%`), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data=TBL, \n    aes(x=SA, y=`SV%`), color=\"#002868\") +\n    geom_beeswarm(\n    data=COL, \n    aes(x=SA, y=`SV%`), color=\"#6F213B\") +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=TBL, \n    aes(x=SA, y=`SV%`, label=Player)) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=COL, \n    aes(x=SA, y=`SV%`, label=Player)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\nlabs(\n    x=\"Shots Against\", \n    y=\"Save Percentage\", \n    title=\"Vasilevskiy saved significantly more shots in 2022\", \n    subtitle=\"Kuemper has a higher save percentage against Vaislevskiy but faced a total of 114 less shots during the season.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | Emma Malone\"\n    ) +\n   theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen comparing the two goalies, Kuemper has a 92% save percentage for the 2022 season. The top 20 goalies for that season in the NHL all have a 91% or higher save percentage. However, when you compare the number of shots each of the team’s goalies faced, 114 shots is like adding on two extra games Vasilveskiy played if we base it on the average shots a goalie faces per game. If Kuemper and Vasilveskiy faced the same number of shots during a season, one could argue that Vasilveskiy would have the higher save percentage.\nTampa Bay fans were on top of the world for two seasons after winning back-to-back Stanley Cups. They made it to the playoffs after a devasting loss of Gourde to the Krakens and have a solid goalie in the net. By all accounts, they had every chance to win the cup. However, the Avalanche maintained true to their explosive shots, leading to more points during the finals series that won games."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Buffalo Bills selected Josh Allen as the seventh overall pick in the 2018 draft; since then, he’s been playing for the Bills but has yet to get the team to a Super Bowl. Most critics argue that Allen was unsuccessful in getting his team to a Super Bowl because he could be better as a quarterback. His biggest flaw is throwing a high number of interceptions. However, when diving into the actual statistics of Allen’s career, he has proven to have the potential to become a great quarterback.\nLet’s look at two legendary quarterbacks the 2000s decades have seen: Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers. Career-wise, the two remain in a tight battle when comparing their career interception and completion percentages. Allen, who is only six years into his career, is creeping towards the two legends with only a little more than half a decade under his belt. It’s obvious Allen has yet to throw as many touchdowns, and passing isn’t the only way to score a touchdown, but coaches want a QB who can also throw the ball. Running can only get you so far in the pro league. So, does Josh Allen have what it takes to separate himself from his peers and prove himself? Potentially.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(waffle)\n\nquarterbacks &lt;- read_csv(\"Quarterbacks.csv\") |&gt;\n  filter(is.na(QBR) == FALSE) |&gt;\n  rename(YdsGained=Yds...13,\n         YdsLost=Yds...28) |&gt;\n  group_by(Player) |&gt;\n  filter(G &gt; 5)\n\nnewqb &lt;- quarterbacks |&gt;\n  group_by(Player) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    TotalCmp = sum(Cmp),\n    TotalAtt = sum(Att),\n    `TotalCmp%` = mean(`Cmp%`),\n    TotalYdsG = sum(YdsGained),\n    TotalTD = sum(TD),\n    `TotalTD%` = mean(`TD%`),\n    TotalInt = sum(Int),\n    `TotalInt%` = mean(`Int%`),\n    TotalSucc = mean(`Succ%`),\n    TotalSk = sum(Sk),\n    TotalYdsLost = sum(YdsLost),\n    `TotalSk%` = mean(`Sk%`)\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(TotalCmp &gt; 100)\n\nJA &lt;- newqb |&gt; filter(Player == \"Josh Allen\")\nTB &lt;- newqb |&gt; filter(Player == \"Tom Brady\")\nAR &lt;- newqb |&gt; filter(Player == \"Aaron Rodgers\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(\n  data=newqb, \n  aes(x=`TotalCmp%`, y=`TotalInt%`, size = TotalTD),\n  color=\"grey\",\n  alpha = .3) +\n  geom_point(\n    data=JA,\n    aes(x=`TotalCmp%`, y=`TotalInt%`, size = TotalTD),\n    color=\"#00338D\"\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data=AR,\n    aes(x=`TotalCmp%`, y=`TotalInt%`, size = TotalTD),\n    color=\"#00338D\"\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data=TB,\n    aes(x=`TotalCmp%`, y=`TotalInt%`, size = TotalTD),\n    color=\"#00338D\"\n  ) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=JA, \n    aes(x=`TotalCmp%`+1, y=`TotalInt%`, label=Player)\n  ) + \n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=AR, \n    aes(x=`TotalCmp%`+1.4, y=`TotalInt%`, label=Player)\n  ) + \n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=TB, \n    aes(x=`TotalCmp%`-1.9, y=`TotalInt%`, label=Player)\n  ) + \n   geom_vline(xintercept = 61.2554) +  \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 2.58929) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2,9), name = \"Touch Downs\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Total Completion Percentage\", \n    y=\"Total Interception Percentage\", \n    title=\"Josh Allen Falls Middle of the Pack in Career Stats\", \n    subtitle=\"The Bill's quarterback after six years of playing pro-football has shown himself to be a good player\\nwhen he's compared to other legendary QBs in career completions and interceptions.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Pro-Football Reference | By Emma Malone\"\n    ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 10)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we look at another unique statistic, such as yards lost and gained from getting sacked, that can also tell us a story. Getting sacked is more of a taboo topic in pro football because you don’t want to be the guy who injures a team’s quarterback. But losing yards to a sack means you must get rid of the ball quickly. Notice who is absent from this graph: none other than a QB legend, Aaron Rodgers. It’s inevitable to get sacked as a quarterback eventually; it will happen many times in a career. Could it have been that Rodgers avoids sacks? Maybe.\n\n\nCode\nnewqb2 &lt;- quarterbacks |&gt;\n  group_by(Player) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    TotalCmp = mean(Cmp),\n    TotalAtt = mean(Att),\n    `TotalCmp%` = mean(`Cmp%`),\n    TotalYdsG = mean(YdsGained),\n    TotalTD = mean(TD),\n    `TotalTD%` = mean(`TD%`),\n    TotalInt = mean(Int),\n    `TotalInt%` = mean(`Int%`),\n    TotalSucc = mean(`Succ%`),\n    TotalSk = mean(Sk),\n    TotalYdsLost = mean(YdsLost),\n    `TotalSk%` = mean(`Sk%`)\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(TotalCmp &gt; 100)\n\n QB &lt;- newqb2 |&gt;\n  top_n(20, wt=TotalYdsG) |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(\n    cols=starts_with(\"TotalYds\"), \n    names_to=\"Type\", \n    values_to=\"Yards\")\n \nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=QB, aes(x=reorder(Player, Yards), weight=Yards, fill=Type)) + \nscale_fill_manual(name=\"Legend\", labels=c(\"Yards Gained\", \"Yards Lost\"), values=c(\"#c60c30\", \"#00338d\")) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Player\", \n    y=\"Yards\", \n    title=\"Quarterbacks Ranked by Yardage from Sacks\", \n    subtitle=\"Career wise, losing yards after getting sacked is really bad, as a quarterback you need to be able to play the ball.\\nJosh Allen is able to play the ball before getting sacked.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Pro-Football Reference | By Emma Malone\"\n    ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the two legends have a 30-sack difference, and Brady remains a leader in this category. This tells us that Rodgers is more likely to gain and lose no yards when sacked. But Allen can play the ball and keep up with other top quarterbacks in the league. In other words, Allen can play the ball efficiently under pressure. As a quarterback, it’s essential to play well under pressure. When your offensive line is leaving gaps and the defensive is closing in, throwing the ball away can work a few times, but not as a permanent solution to pressure.\nAllen has stayed caught up with his peers, who started playing professionally around the same time he did. We can find some pretty exciting things if we look at two other quarterbacks he is most compared to, Patrick Mahomes and Justin Herbert. As I mentioned, running the ball can only get you so far as a quarterback; you need to be able to play the ball. If we compare throwing touchdowns and interceptions from this past season alone between the three, we learn some new things.\n\n\nCode\njoshallen &lt;- c(\"Touchdown\"=29, \"Interception\"=18)\npatmahomes &lt;- c(\"Touchdown\"=29, \"Interception\"=14)\njherbert &lt;- c(\"Touchdown\"=20, \"Interception\"=7)\n\niron( \nwaffle(\n        joshallen, \n        rows = 5, \n        colors = c(\"#00338D\", \"#C60C30\")) + \n  labs(\n    x=\"Josh Allen\",\n    title=\"Comparing Other Young Quarterbacks To Allen\", \n    subtitle=\"Throwing an interception can lose a team a game, However Josh Allen\\nstill managed to throw a high number of touchdowns this past season.\") + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title.y = element_blank()\n  ),\nwaffle(\n        patmahomes, \n        rows = 5, \n        colors = c(\"#E31837\", \"#FFB81C\")) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Patrick Mahomes\"),\nwaffle(\n        jherbert, \n        rows = 4, \n        colors = c(\"#0073cf\", \"#ffb612\")) +\nlabs(\n     x=\"Justin Herbert \\n1 square = 1 touchdown or interception\",\n     caption=\"Source: Pro-Football Sports Reference | Graphic by Emma Malone\"\n     ))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAllen and Mahomes are tied in touchdowns thrown for the season at 29, Herbert behind the two with 20 touchdowns. Allen has thrown the most interceptions with 18, Mahomes at 14, and Herbert at 7. This tells us that Herbert is likelier to run the ball, whereas Mahomes and Allen prefer to throw the ball more often, leading to more potential interceptions, which can cost the game if thrown at the wrong time.\nOverall, Josh Allen can be proven to be a good quarterback. However, he has his moments, which cost him and his team the game. But for the Bills Mafia, their time might be coming soon and finally playing in a Super Bowl."
